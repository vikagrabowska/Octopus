# Octopus
Octopus is web-based font testing tool to run locally in your web browser. 
Created by Viktoriya Grabowska and Szymon Marciniak. 
Special thanks to Eben Sorkin and Dave Crossland.

Download the repo and make a copy into a folder (Even your applications folder if you want) and then open the index.html file. To make the fonts you want to test available to the tool put them in the 'fonts' folder of the tool. Octopus does not see installed fonts on your computer. To make test texts available to load into the tool put them in the 'assets' folder

If the tool runs into an issue or doesn't see a change in your font you may want to refresh your browser or quit the browser and restart it.

Octopus can test variable fonts and static fonts.

Octopus was made to test fonts with large design spaces more efficiently. To help with this it offers you up to six different views of a variable font all at the same time. It also allows you choose your views on or in between masters. Looking in between masters makes it easier to catch inconsistencies in your design, spacing or interpolation problems.

Octopus is also useful for comparing your design to other designs, your roman to your italic and so on.

Octopus can use premade texts to test into. 

A growing body of sample texts are available here: https://github.com/SorkinType/octo-text
